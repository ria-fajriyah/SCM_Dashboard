# SCM Power BI Dashboard
A professional project I worked on during my role as Business Intelligence Intern at Samator Group, where I developed a Supply Chain Management (SCM) Dashboard to help the SCM team track their order progress, performance, and shipment efficiency.

# Project Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of Sales Orders (SO) and Transfer Orders (TO) along with their statuses, SLA compliance, and shipment efficiency. [The dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hmgC5IQfhZFjJP-cmHODfhrrF0AQZNLoe4oMbX2YtvM/edit?usp=sharing) includes detailed order, customer, and logistics information. 

# Dashboard Pages
## 1. Dashboard Overview Page
This page provides a summary of total Sales Orders (SO) and Transfer Orders (TO) by supply site, along with order status details and Service Level Agreement (SLA) monitoring.

## 3. SCM Shipment Efficiency Page
This page analyzes the efficiency of shipments, comparing delivery distance with nearest plant gaps and offering insights for route optimization and performance.

# Data Source
[The dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hmgC5IQfhZFjJP-cmHODfhrrF0AQZNLoe4oMbX2YtvM/edit?usp=sharing) used in this project is a replicated version of the operational database (not production data). It was created to resemble the original structure for portfolio purposes.

# Tools & Prerequisites
